# Starting a GitHub enabled project

While there are many ways to start a project on your machine that is also GitHub enabled, it is easier to take steps in a specific order.

- Make the repository on GitHub using a web browser
	- Include the default `README.md` file and a `.gitignore` file. You may choose to also add a License.
- Clone the repo to the desired location on your machine, using the instructions in the "Code" button on your repo's webpage. Note: do *not* download a Zip file; you must actually *clone* the repo.
- Add subdirectories for your project skeleton
- Edit the `README.md` to add your project information
- Edit the `.gitignore` to exclude data or figures directories (or anything that will be large files)
- Commit your changes locally, push your changes to GitHub
- Copy any other files you need to your project
- Commit. Push.
- Start coding. Commit. Push.
