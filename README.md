# cfw2022

Computational fluency workshop materials for summer students at Brown.

*Note*: Repo is fixed for the year 2022 for backwards compatibility with demos.

The `data` subdirectory contains small data sets for use in exercises.

The `reference` subdirectory contains reference notes on various topics.

The environment files can be used with `conda` to create a python virtual environment with useful modules for doing the 
exercises. A good place to start is the following command in a terminal (make sure you're in the same working directory):
```shell
conda env create -f environment_minimal.yml
```
Once the environment `cfw` is created, you can activate it with
```shell
conda activate cfw
```
